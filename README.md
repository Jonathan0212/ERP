## Future Development 
The application could be expanded to include other modules to meet different business needs. Employee maintenance, Payroll, Raw material and Service vendors. If it takes its final form, it could be a true ERP or MRP that could track production including tooling, material and services lead times, production times and shipping that would give accurate capability to track costs and to estimate production costs for potential customers.
